# 🎮 MistypeMania - Word Misspelling Challenge

A unique and challenging word game where players must intentionally misspell words using all the correct letters! Test your creativity and quick thinking with randomized virtual keyboards and time pressure.

## 🎯 Game Concept

MistypeMania flips traditional spelling games on their head. Instead of spelling words correctly, you must create **creative misspellings** using exactly the same letters as the original word.

### Example:
- **Original Word:** `APPLE`
- **Valid Misspellings:** `PLEAP`, `PPLEA`, `EPPLA`, `LAPEP`
- **Invalid:** `APLE` (missing letters), `APPLES` (extra letters), `APPLE` (correct spelling)

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start Screen:** Read the instructions and click "Let's Play!"
2. **Choose Difficulty:** Select Easy, Medium, or Pro mode
3. **Misspell Words:** Use the virtual keyboard to create wrong spellings
4. **Beat the Clock:** Complete each word within the time limit
5. **Progress:** Advance through all words in your chosen difficulty

|------|------------|-----------------|
| 🌱 **Easy** | 15 seconds | Simple words |
